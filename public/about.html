<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate and adaptable engineer with a solid foundation in both Mechanical Engineering and Informatics, combining the physical precision of automotive systems with the logic and flexibility of software development.

My career began as a Service Counselor at Quark Motors Arad, where I was responsible for managing client interactions, coordinating service schedules, and overseeing leasing fleet operations. This role sharpened my organizational and communication abilities in a fast-paced, customer-focused environment.

I then advanced to Technical Counselor at Autonom, where I conducted technical evaluations, coordinated vehicle maintenance, and ensured fleet performance met high standards. This position developed my technical judgment, reliability, and ability to manage logistics efficiently.

Currently, I work as a Harness Design Engineer at Leoni, where I design, validate, and optimize automotive wiring harnesses for global OEMs. I collaborate across departments and engineering domains to ensure our harness systems meet strict functional, quality, and safety standards. I enjoy the mix of technical detail and collaborative design thinking that this role requires.</p>

<p>Personal passions: Car design, bodywork 3D modeling, and programming, especially where engineering meets creativity.</p>

<p>Each role, project, and academic path has shaped how I approach challenges with logic, curiosity, and a commitment to building solutions that work.</p>
