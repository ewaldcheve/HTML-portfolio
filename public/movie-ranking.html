 <h1>Best Movies according to Ewald</h1>

 <h2>Some of the movies that i enjoyed in the last time</h2>

 <hr/>

 <h3>
Oppenheimer</h3>
<P>Was good because it showed the depravity of humanity and how far will people go only to feel powerful and know that others are afraid of them.We are so selfish as to create weapons that are too much for us only the flex our tiny dicks to other frustrated tiny dicks.</P>
 

<h3>Saw</h3>
<p>Loved the vendetta agenda, the vengence factor and how each subject was punished for his or hers wrongdoings.</p>

<H3>My life, my life</H3>
<p>Makes you wanna run away</p>
